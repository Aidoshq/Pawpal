# AI Usage

## AI Tools Used

During the development of PawPal, I used ChatGPT as an AI assistant.

AI was mainly used for:
- explaining Jetpack Compose concepts;
- debugging Kotlin and Compose errors;
- suggesting UI improvements;
- helping with Navigation Compose;
- reviewing and improving code structure.

## Example Prompts

### Prompt 1
"How can I create navigation between HomeScreen and DetailScreen using Navigation Compose and pass the pet ID?"

This helped me implement Navigation Compose with route arguments.

### Prompt 2
"How can I create a reusable pet card in Jetpack Compose with an image, pet name, breed, and age?"

This helped with the structure of the reusable PetCard component.

### Prompt 3
"How can I add light and dark mode previews for my Jetpack Compose screens?"

This helped me create @Preview functions for both light and dark themes.

## AI Error and Fix

During development, AI-generated code did not always work correctly on the first attempt.

One issue occurred when changes were made to the DetailScreen parameters without updating all calls to DetailScreen in MainActivity. This caused compilation errors.

I fixed the problem by checking the function parameters and updating the corresponding Navigation Compose callbacks in MainActivity.

Another issue was a large pet placeholder image that caused a Canvas bitmap error. I fixed it by resizing the image before using it in the Compose UI.

## Manual Changes

I reviewed and modified the AI-generated code manually.

Some of the changes I made include:
- adjusting the PawPal screen layout;
- changing text and labels;
- choosing the final color scheme;
- testing light and dark modes;
- testing pet creation and deletion;
- testing care task creation, editing, completion, and deletion;
- checking navigation between screens;
- organizing the project files;
- testing the application on the Android emulator.

AI was used as a development assistant, but the final application was tested and adjusted manually.
